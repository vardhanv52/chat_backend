# Chat Application

The APIs were developed in NodeJS. The application is based on Micro Services architecture. It is implemented using Express Gateway which is based on ExpressJS.

The application consists of three services

- General Service: Session related APIs
- User Service: User related APIs
- Chat Service: Groups and Messages related APIs

Ideally, the env file will be included in gitignore. Removed it for now, so that you guys can have a look at it, if needed.

Currently the application is hosted in an AWS EC2 T2 micro instance.

The API documentation for the application can be found in following link:

In order to test these APIs, an android application will also be submitted in the next 24 hrs as part of my android assignment.
